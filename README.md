# Higer (Tiger + Haskell)



### Setting up the project
* Install stack by following the instructions on the official [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) page. 
* Stack sets up a separate environment for the project which does not interfere with  the already installed GHC and libraries.

Run the project as follows:
```
$> chmod 755 show_tree.sh
$> ./show_tree.sh programs/record1.tig 
```

### What has been done so far
